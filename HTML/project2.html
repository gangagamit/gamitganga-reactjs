                        <pre><h1>HTML</h1>
                            <b>Html is the standard markup language for Web pages.
                            With HTML you can create your own Website.
                            HTML is easy to learn - You will enjoy it!
                            HTML is primarily used to develop web pages and 
                            web applications that run on web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer. 
                            HTML tags are keywords present on a web page that define how your web browser must format and 
                            display the contents.</b>
                            </pre>

                                        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
                                        CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
                                        CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
                                        External stylesheets are stored in CSS files
                                        HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!
                                        HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:
                                        This is a heading
                                        This is a paragraph.
                                        When tags like <font>, 
                                        and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. 
                                        Development of large websites, where fonts and color 
                                        information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.
                                        To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.
                                        CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!</b></pre>
                                        </div>
                                    
                                
                                

                    </div>

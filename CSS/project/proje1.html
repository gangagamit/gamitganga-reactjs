                    <h1>Benefits of Hobbies</h1>
                <h2>Physical</h2>
                     Physical hobbies have clear physiological benefits because they increase both your heart rate and brain function. Other benefits include lower blood pressure, weight loss, building muscle, strengthening bones, and an overall increase in energy.
                    
                    Examples: hiking, camping, swimming, yoga, or martial arts
                    
                    <h2>Mental and Emotional</h2>
                    Carving out time for activities you enjoy is an easy way to improve your mental health and overall emotional well-being. Hobbies decrease stress by relaxing you and taking your mind off the more pressing concerns of daily life like work and paying bills. Also, hobbies can give us a sense of mastery and control. Our esteem level tends to rise as we feel ever more accomplished at a particular task. The following examples have been associated with improved mental health and depression reduction.
                    
                    Examples: gardening, listening to music, painting or drawing, cooking, coloring, and photography
                    
                   <h2> Social and Interpersonal</h2>
                    Hobbies are a great way to socialize and meet new friends. Social hobbies facilitate bonds with others and add another layer of support to your life serving to reduce stress. Meet Up is a widely used platform for people to “meet new people, learn new things, find support, get out of their comfort zones, and pursue their passions, together” (Meetup, 2019, para. 1). There are dozens of groups in every city dedicated to all kinds of group activities. It is likely that you will find others interested in the same things you are, and there will be a meetup group already established. If not, you can create your own meetup group.
                    
                    Examples: exploring new restaurants, seeing movies, discussing philosophy, trying new technology, playing music, playing games, and investing in real estate
                    
                    <h2>Creativity</h2>
                    Some hobbies inspire us to tap into our creative side. This can be especially helpful for people who have no creative outlets at their work. Engaging in a creative hobby can help train your brain to be more creative in other areas of your life.
                   <h2> Self-Improvement</h2>
Some people enjoy hobbies that give them the opportunity to improve their confidence level, boost their self-esteem, and improve their quality of life. If you are thinking about a hobby like this, consider whether there is something you would like to change about yourself or improve upon. For example, would you like to be a competent public speaker, lose weight, or become more heart healthy? Do you need to improve your attention to detail, or would you like to learn a new language?

Examples: traveling alone, cooking, meditation, completing puzzles, journaling, or volunteering.
